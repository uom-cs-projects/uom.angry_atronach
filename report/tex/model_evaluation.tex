    \subsection{Applying the Model}
      \todo{
        \item Attempted applying the model to AAI
        \item No written content, just the graph
        \item Ran into a lot of problems, including the following
        \item Inconsistent usage of terminology: Handling different languages (different terminology can be considered a different language, even though it's all English) is important. Simple solution is to resolve conflicting terminology. Complex solution unknown.
        \item Tried to apply model from bottom up, looking for small bits of knowledge and then identifying dependencies: Mistake: Should have refined from the top down!
        \item Include graph?
      }
