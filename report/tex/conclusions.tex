\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}
  This chapter contains a review of everything covered so far, as well as some suggestions for future work based on this review. I also include some recommendations on ways to improve educational systems based both on the review in Chapter \ref{chapter:background} and my proposed model described in Chapter \ref{chapter:design}.

  \section{Reflection}
    \todo{
      \item Should have focussed more on the theoretical stuff: Test the model rather than creating a prototype website: I would have liked to have spent more time on example material, perhaps fully applied my model to a course \'on paper\'.
