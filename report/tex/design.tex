\chapter{Design}
  This chapter describes and justifies the final design decisions I made, as well as explaining some of the key changes I made to the design as I learned more. Technical details are left to the Implementation chapter: This chapter remains at a higher level, focussing on the model used and the overall architecture of the system.
