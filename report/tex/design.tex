\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:design}
  This chapter describes and justifies the final design decisions I made, as well as explaining some of the key changes I made to the design as I learned more. Technical details are left to Chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}: This chapter remains at a higher level, focussing on the model used and the overall architecture of the system.

  \section{Requirements}
  \section{Model}
    A considerable portion of the time allocated to this project was spent on developing a model to represent elements of the learning process. This model underwent a number of changes. In this section I will mostly discuss the final model.
