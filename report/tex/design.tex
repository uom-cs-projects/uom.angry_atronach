\chapter{Software Design}
\label{chapter:design}
  This chapter describes and justifies the final design decisions I made, as well as explaining some of the key changes I made to the design as I learned more. Technical details are left to Chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}: This chapter remains at a higher level, focussing on the model used and the overall architecture of the system.

      \item The purpose is to act as a prototype for future tools, and a way to test how practical my model is for people to actually use
    }
  \section{Requirements}
    \todo{\item}

  \section{Architecture}
