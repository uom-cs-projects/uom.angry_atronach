\chapter{Background Knowledge}
\label{chapter:background}
  This chapter details the knowledge required to understand this report. There is also review of various educational practices, which forms the basis for many of my design choices.

  \section{Existing Work}
  \section{Review of Current Practices}
    It seems logical to start an attempt to make learning easier with a review of the currently used practices.

    \todo{
      \item Mention the key areas for improvement
      \item Summarise any other key findings
    }

    \subsection{The Learning Process}
      Regardless of how it is implemented, a working learning process needs the following features:

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A way of selecting goals: Somehow we must decide what it is we want to learn.

        \item A way to motivate the student: It is not possible to learn \emph{for} someone. Learning requires students to do a lot of thinking on their own, which will only happen if they are sufficiently motivated.

        \item A method of acquiring new knowledge: This can vary from reading books, to attending lectures, to inventing entirely new knowledge. Note that research can be viewed as a special type of learning.

        \item A method of testing whether the new knowledge was successfully acquired: If there is no measure of success, then there is no way to be certain any progress was made.

        \item A method of dealing with failure: Although it is conceivably possible that a student could never make any mistakes, most students don't have perfect performance. There must be a process to detect the cause of problems and find a solution in any system of practical use.
      \end{itemize}



    \subsection{Selecting Goals}
      \todo{
        \item There are a number of choices over what to learn that do not seem to make very much sense: What make everyone study Shakespeare? What about specialist subjects that are not optional? Why is critical thinking not part of the core curriculum? Why are widely useful software engineering skills left until third year, yet group project work is done predominantely in the first and second years?

        \item Selecting goals is difficult: It requires knowledge of the distribution of skills being used in industry. It also requires sufficient structural information about knowledge to distinguish skills from each other and teach them in isolation.

        \item What we really need is data: How is our current knowledge structured, and how many people use individual skills (and in which professions).
      }

    \subsection{Student Motivation}
      \todo{
        \item Inappropriately selected goals lead to disillusioned students: They know what they are doing isn't practically useful. Their performance is decreased unless they are exceptional \emph{grinders}.

        \item Motivation seems to be often forgotten. Not much effort is made to show how lessons are of practical value to students. It would be good if every skill could be linked to real examples: This is the essence of \emph{roles}.

        \item Some courses attempt to motivate students through real-life examples. This has mixed results: Sometimes the examples are not realistic, other times they are realistic but inapproriate to the student's goals (maths may be useful for a scientist, but maybe the student is hoping to work in textiles: They must know that maths is useful in their area of interest).
      }

    \subsection{Knowledge Acquisition}
    \subsection{Testing}
      \todo{
        \item Group testing is meaningless outside of that group (can't isolate individual performance, group will be disbanded soon, eliminating utility of test)

        \item Lots of tests collapse information into a single score: Detail is lost, utility is compromised. A single percentage score cannot tell you whether a student undestands A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, or nothing completely. Only a 100\% or 0\% score tells you anything concrete about their actual knowledge. Testing multiple variables with one score makes no sense! Tests need to be designed with utility in mind: Who is going to use the test score and what does it reliably tell them?

        \item Lots of tests are game-able: Answers can be memorized and there are numerous examples of lots of time being dedicated to preparing for specific exam techniques and model answers in my education. The tests can't reliably seperate those who fully understand the questions, and those who \emph{grind}.

        \item Many tests only test a portion of a course. Why put something on a course if you are not going to check that it has been learened? That's much like adding features to a program but never writing tests for them. Who knows if your work was worth it?
