  \todo{
    \item Research could be supported by the graph: Research is usually based on existing work, so it can be considered an extension of the graph. Research happens at leaves.
    \item If researchers could link their work into a graph, it would be trivial to work out what you need to read up on in order to understand a given paper/report.
    \item Searches for existing work in an area would be as simple as finding the function you wish to extend and looking at the dependents
    \item Custom textbooks (simply a series of static pages) could be generated to suit a given starting knowledge and goal: Courses can be modified more easily as the material is broken into parts and their dependencies are recorded
    \item Roles: Job descriptions and applications are made easier when you can reference some publicly listed functions.
