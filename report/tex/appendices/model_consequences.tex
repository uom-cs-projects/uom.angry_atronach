\chapter{Model: Consequences}
  \todo{
    \item Any interesting but not necessary consequences of the model
    \item gameification of education: Increased motivation from being able to track progress and distance to goals
    \item Real life learning is very similar to the skill \'trees\' found in games. Many of the things that make this part fo games fun could be adopted when using this model.
    \item Knowing how to do something doesn't necessarily mean you can explain how you do it: Only functionality explicitly defined is actually guaranteed: Humans as computers means that it would be better to know how you do stuff, because then you could perform some sort of review and optimise function. Reviewing and optimising cannot happen if you cannot access data about the functions you wish to optimise.
