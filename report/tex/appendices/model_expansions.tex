\chapter{Model: Expansions}
  \todo{
    \item Not in-depth, just a mention of ways future work could expand the model.
    \item Handling other languages
    \item Handling motor skills
    \item Representing skills inaccessible to those with disabilities
    \item Handling performance issues: e.g. perform A within X seconds, as opposed to just perform A
    \item Performance can be improved by eliminating direct dependencies when an indirect dependency exists already
    \item Naming: How can terminology be kept unambiguous in an acyclic graph?
