\label{chapter:context}
  This chapter outlines the motivation behind this project and the resulting high level goals.

  \section{Motivation}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Joined university
      \item The pace of learning was a lot faster than at college, but it wasn't any harder (it was actually easier, because I was more motivated, plus labs)
      \item Thought a lot about my time in education
      \item Eventually, sat down and had a think about the structure of my courses while on holiday
      \item Had to leave third year part way through: Very disillusioned with education: More important than ever that I didn't get put off learning anthing new: Really started to care about improvements to education
      \item In my time off, seriously reflected on all the practices I'd experienced
      \item Decided to do this project: Wanted to examine how I could make education smoother
    \end{itemize}

  \section{Goals}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Review current educational practices
      \item Improve the availability of education outside of formal institutions (many people cannot afford to go, both with time constraints and money: They need something flexible, perhaps something they can do without assistance)
      \item Improve the quality of education
    \end{itemize}
