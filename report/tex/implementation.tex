\chapter{Software Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}
  This chapter follows the implementation of my prototype website. The focus is on the practical challenges involved in implementing the designs discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:design}. I have included a section specifically addressing the technical and organisational lessons learned.

  \section{Tools}
    \subsection{Atom}
      \todo{
        \item Highly customizable IDE
        \item Plugins for everything I wanted: Support for every language, even a pdf viewer for writing my report
        \item Familiar with the tool
        \item Works on multiple platforms, I use both windows and a linux laptop
        \item Don't rely on integrated functionality in my build tools: Other people could use their own tools or I could swap things out without pain
      }

    \subsection{Git and GitHub}
      \todo{
        \item git for version control
        \item GitHub for several reasons
        \item Backed up on a public server
        \item Issue tracking to aid management
        \item Statistics I can look back on in my reflection
        \item Lots of experience using it
      }

  \section{Technology}
    \subsection{Scala}
      \todo{
        \item Chose to use Scala as my language of choice
        \item Experience with Java helps
        \item Wanted to learn something new without too much stress
        \item Could switch back to java if there was trouble without significant loss of time
        \item Compiles to JVM, so no need to worry about what platform we're running on
        \item Compatibility with Java means lots of libraries available
        \item Scala appears to involve less boilerplate code (may have changed a little with latest Java updates)
      }

    \subsection{Play Framework}
      \todo{
        \item Play framework
        \item Scala native
        \item Java native too, so easy to fallback of Java
        \item Works with Heroku flawlessly
        \item Good documentation
        \item appears to be a mature framework (had issues with Scalatra because of this)
      }

    \subsection{neo4j}
      \todo{
        \item neo4j
        \item Graph database very suitable for problem domain
        \item Uses Cypher, a very neat query language
        \item neo4j-ogm
        \item neo4j-ogm has problems: Java based, bean based. I would have liked to make some properties immutable, but neo4j-ogm requires that the objects you create for it are mutable. Makes the model less safe as uuids might accidentally be modified.
      }

    \subsection{Heroku}
      \todo{
        \item Heroku
        \item Very easy to set up: Deploying involves a push
        \item Mention what the name literally means
        \item Free for development!
        \item Various graph databases were supported as addons
      }

  \section{Methodology}
    \todo{
      \item Proceeded in iterations one week long
      \item Every week includes a short reflection on the previous week: Identify some improvement to make to the process.
      \item All tasks tracked in GitHub
    }

  \section{Key Events}
    \subsection{Chnages to Database}
      \todo{
        \item Took a long time to decide
        \item started off using a relational db model with Squeryl as my ORM, so I could select whatever database was suitable. Wasn't much work in the end to convert what I'd come up with in Squeryl to neo4j-ogm: Also the model changed at the time, so I had to redo some stuff anyway
        \item Used the built in db of scalatra, h2, during development
        \item relational wouldn't do, so considered a mix of graph data and relational for the contents of nodes: Overcomplicated
        \item Tried OrientDB. Too difficult to set up due to difficult documentation.
        \item Came across some indications that OrientDB might not be a stable choice, decided to look at some other options
        \item tried neo4j: Managed to set it up very quickly and Cypher was really good. Docs excellent: Stick with whatever gets me up and running first
      }

    \subsection{Change of Stack}
      \todo{
        \item I started out using a different web stack:
        Scalatra, the code looked the simplest to read and made it easy for me to get started: Unfortunately the docs turned out to be lacking, and making a public deployment as well as connecting to a graph db was hard
        \item Trying to set up a publicly accessible version of the site was a pain: I figured out it would be quicker to use Play and Heroku, porting over any old functionality I could reuse: Changes in model made it worth it
        \item The first stack could be seen as a waste of time, but I really needed to learn new stuff, so I've taken it as a learning experience.
      }
